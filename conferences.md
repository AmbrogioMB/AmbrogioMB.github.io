# Conferences and workshops

Presentations I gave for different conferences and workshops.

### *Scheduling elective surgeries under uncertainty: a multi-objective stochastic approach*


* [ICCOPT / MOPTA 2022](https://iccopt2022.lehigh.edu/), Lehigh University, Bethlehem, Pennsylvania;
* YAMC 2022 (video of my talk [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0_yxyK-zK4&t=1232s)), Arenzano, Italy.

[Slides](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmbrogioMB/AmbrogioMB.github.io/main/files/healthcare.pdf) I used in Arenzano and [video](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmbrogioMB/AmbrogioMB.github.io/main/files/demo_rec.mp4) referenced in slide 27.

This work got the **second place** out of 13 submissions at the [14th AIMMS-MOPTA Optimization Modeling Competition](https://iccopt2022.lehigh.edu/competition-and-prizes/aimms-mopta-competition/).

### *A MILP approach to a structured ensemble Binarized Neural Network*

* [The Mathematics of Machine Learning](http://www.crm.sns.it/event/506/) (presented by Simone Milanesi), Pisa, Italy;
* [LION17 - The 2023 Learning and Intelligent OptimizatioN Conference](https://lion17.org/), Nice, France.

[Slides](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmbrogioMB/AmbrogioMB.github.io/main/files/bnn_nizza.pdf) I used in Nice.

### *A linear approximation for a stochastic optimal power flow problem based on wind energy sources*
