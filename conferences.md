# Visiting periods

### TU Delft

I spent one month, from mid-April to mid-May 2023, in [TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/), Delft, Netherlands, as a guest of [STAR Lab](https://starlab.ewi.tudelft.nl/), working on AI and optimization with Dr. Neil Yorke-Smith. The funding for my visiting period was provided by [TAILOR](https://tailor-network.eu/) after having been **awarded** a [Connectivity Fund](https://tailor-network.eu/optimal-training-of-a-structured-ensemble-of-binarized-neural-networks-with-mixed-integer-linear-programming-techniques/).


### USI

I spent six months, from September 2023 to February 2024, in [USI](https://www.usi.ch/it), Lugano, Switzerland, as part of my Ph.D. joint program, working on integrality gap problems with Professor Luca Maria Gambardella.
