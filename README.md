## Position

PhD student in Computational Mathematics and Decision Sciences at [Università degli Studi di Pavia](https://web.unipv.it/) / [Università della Svizzera Italiana](https://www.usi.ch/it).



## Current Projects

Projects I'm currently working on:

* binary neural networks;
* stochastic optimal power flow, in collaboration with [CESI](https://www.cesi.it/);
* stochastic scheduling problems.



## Conferences and Workshops

**Conferences where I presented the work *Scheduling elective surgeries under uncertainty: a multi-objective stochastic approach* :**

* [ICCOPT / MOPTA 2022](https://iccopt2022.lehigh.edu/);
* [YAMC 2022](yamc.it/) (video of my talk [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0_yxyK-zK4&t=1232s)).

[Presentation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmbrogioMB/AmbrogioMB.github.io/main/healthcare.pdf) and [video](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmbrogioMB/AmbrogioMB.github.io/main/demo_rec.mp4) referenced in slide 27. This work got the second place out of 13 submissions at the [14th AIMMS-MOPTA Optimization Modeling Competition](https://iccopt2022.lehigh.edu/competition-and-prizes/aimms-mopta-competition/).

**Conferences where I presented the work *A MILP approach to a structured ensemble Binarized Neural Network* :**

* [Matematica per l'Intelligenza Artificiale e il Machine Learning - Giovani ricercatori](https://areeweb.polito.it/disma-excellence/events_2022/GiornateUMI/index.html).
* [The Mathematics of Machine Learning](http://www.crm.sns.it/event/506/) (presented by Simone Milanesi).

## Education

**High school**

From September 2011 to July 2016 I was enrolled at Liceo Scientifico Statale Torquato Taramelli. I obtained my high school diploma on the 11th of July 2016, with the following results: 100 / 100, discussing the essay *I barbari. Saggio sulla mutazione* by Alessandro Baricco.
During high school, I participated in several students competitions, such as the ANISN Natural Science Olympiads (regional phase in 2013, 2014, 2015), the *Gran Premio di Matematica Applicata* (7th place in 2016), and the Italian Mathematical Olympiad (team semifinalist in 2016, team finalist and 35th place in 2015). 


**Bachelor's degree**

From October 2016 to September 2019 I was enrolled in the Bachelor's degree Course in Mathematics at the University of Pavia. I graduated on the 19th of September 2019 with the following result: 110 / 110 cum laude. On that date, I discussed my Bachelor's Thesis *Rappresentazioni Lineari di Gruppi Finiti* (pdf [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmbrogioMB/AmbrogioMB.github.io/main/tesi.pdf)), written under the supervision of Professor Alberto Canonaco. 

**Master's Degree**

From October 2019 to September 2021 I was enrolled in the Master's degree Course in Mathematics at the University of Pavia. During this period, I benefited from a scholarship awarded to me following an evaluation of my qualifications, an oral and a written test, and the achievement of objectives concerning grades in the Master's degree course exams and obtaining my degree within a set timeframe. I graduated on the 23rd of September 2021 with the following result: 110 / 110 cum laude. On that date, I discussed my Master's Thesis *Aspetti Algebrici e Combinatori della Teoria degli Operad* (pdf [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmbrogioMB/AmbrogioMB.github.io/main/tesi_m.pdf)), written under the supervision of Professor Alberto Canonaco. 


## Seminars, schools, and workshops organization

I am a co-organizer of [Caffè Beltrami](https://sites.google.com/view/caffebeltrami/), a cycle of seminars aimed at introducing different areas of research in mathematics to Bachelor's and Master's students.
