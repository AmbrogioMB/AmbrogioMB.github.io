## Visiting periods

**TU Delft**


I spent one month from mid-April to mid-May 2023 in [TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/), Delft, Netherlands, as a guest of the [STAR Lab](https://starlab.ewi.tudelft.nl/) working on AI and optimization with Dr. Neil Yorke-Smith. The funding for my visiting period was provided by [TAILOR](https://tailor-network.eu/).
