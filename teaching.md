### Thesis

In collaboration with Professor Stefano Gualandi, I am open to following students in writing their Bachelor's and Master's Thesis. Current open projects regard the study of the operation of power systems, in particular the AC Optimal Power Flow problem, and combinatorial problems, focusing in particular on the Steiner Tree problem. The following is a list of theses I recently co-supervised.

* *The Cloven Travelling Salesman: a new Approach to the ATSP Integrality Gap Estimation*, Alessandro Sosso, Master's Thesis in Mathematics at University of Pavia, co-supervisor, 2024.
* *On the exactness of Jabr-like models and distributionally robust stochastic optimal power flow*, Gabor Riccardi, Master's Thesis in Mathematics at University of Pavia, co-supervisor, 2023.
* *Analisi di architetture per Binarized Neural Networks*, Andrea Panno, Bachelor's Thesis in Bioengineering at University of Pavia, co-supervisor, 2023.
